# Matching Game App

React.js version of @marcobrunodev's vanilla JS Matching Game

## To-do
It is not completed, as it doesn't yet recognize matches, nor accounts for points. Accordingly, the game has no end, nor a reset function.

Though the tutorial is not yet finished, I intend to try and work out these functionalities on my own, as this is a study project :)
